fix row css (messy code)

replace unnecessary complex css code

fix col-1-2

fix box transform + the icon to add the webpage one (css)

scroll smooth (when click project button)

planning to take off top right link like the resume, about and other as
they stop my site from being responsive (maybe keep 1)

when I finish my site maybe support for firefox? -moz

finish the composition attribute in the style.css

fix responsive for back end and front end title
